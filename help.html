        <button class="accordion">What is web accessibility?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Accessibility, in the context of the web and digital content, refers to the design and development
                practices that ensure everyone, including people with disabilities, can freely access and interact with
                web content. It is about making the web usable for as many people as possible, regardless of their
                abilities or disabilities.</p>
            <p>Accessibility takes into account all forms of disabilities — including visual, auditory, physical,
                speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities. The goal is to create a web experience that's flexible
                and accommodating to different users' needs and preferences. This includes creating content that's
                readable and understandable and ensuring functionalities can be operated by everyone.</p>
            <p>In simple terms, web accessibility ensures an equal and inclusive web experience for everyone.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Why is web accessibility important?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Web accessibility is important because it ensures that all users, regardless of their abilities, have
                equal access to information and functionality on the internet.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">How to use this checklist?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The Web Accessibility Checklist is easy to use. Simply access the "Checklist" page and follow each item
                on the list.
                Each item has a description and a checkbox for you to mark. Ensure all items are marked to have a fully
                accessible website.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What aspects are being assessed in the Checklist?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The Web Accessibility Checklist aims to address key aspects underlined by Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for creating an inclusive digital experience. These involve:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Semantic Elements:</strong> The usage of correct HTML elements for their given purpose to provide important context to screen readers and other assistive technologies.</li>
                <li><strong>Text Alternatives for Images and Multimedia:</strong> Ensuring that descriptive alt text is provided for images, and captions or transcripts are provided for audio and video content.</li>
                <li><strong>Keyboard Accessibility:</strong> Allowing websites to be fully navigable using only a keyboard, which is crucial for users who cannot use a mouse or a similar pointing device.</li>
                <li><strong>Text Size and Spacing:</strong> Ensuring the text is large enough and spaced appropriately to be legible and easy to read.</li>
                <li><strong>Color Contrast:</strong> Ensuring there is enough contrast between the text color and its background, making it easier to read for users with moderately low vision.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By addressing these critical elements, your website would be better designed for accessibility, improving the web experience for all of your users.</p>
